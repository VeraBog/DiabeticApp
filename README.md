# DiabeticApp
I have created an app for my college classes. The app contains a Login and Register screen. The main functionality of this app is to count how many units of insulin a patient must take after each meal. Additionally, the app provides the ability to show the level of glucose, weight, etc. The calculation of insulin units is based on the 1800 method. I created the app using C# and WPF. More specific details are included in presentation.
